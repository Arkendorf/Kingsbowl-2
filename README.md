# Kingsbowl 2
The second in a series of multiplayer medieval-themed football games

## Running the Game
Kingsbowl 2 uses the LÖVE engine, and the .zip file can be run using the LÖVE application.
Alternatively, you can use the .exe or .app file to run the game, for Windows and MacOS respectively.

## Hosting a Server
Currently, I've only gotten the game working on LAN - mainly because I haven't messed around with my router enough. 
The game can theoretically work over the internet.
Once in-game, enter the desired port you want to host on in the port field. (ignore the IP field, that's for joining)
Press the "Host" button, and you're good to go!

## Joining a Server
Enter the IP and port of the device you're connecting to, then press "Join".

## Controls
### Mouse & Keyboard
Use WASD to move.
Mouse to look around.
Click to either throw the ball/shoot the arrow (as the quarterback), attack (as defense), or block (as offense).

### Controller
Use the left stick to move.
Use the right stick to look around.
Use any button to perform your action (as mentioned above).
